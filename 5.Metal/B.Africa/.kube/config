Your Kubernetes control-plane has initialized successfully!

To start using your cluster, you need to run the following as a regular user:

  mkdir -p $HOME/.kube
  sudo cp -i /etc/kubernetes/admin.conf $HOME/.kube/config
  sudo chown $(id -u):$(id -g) $HOME/.kube/config

You should now deploy a pod network to the cluster.
Run "kubectl apply -f [podnetwork].yaml" with one of the options listed at:
  https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/cluster-administration/addons/

You can now join any number of control-plane nodes by copying certificate authorities
and service account keys on each node and then running the following as root:

  kubeadm join congo.ecocenter.live:6443 --token 4ie91s.ynlyq7gizp3u9b4b \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6d1780525a2467ce9c1ed9f1a25f8c9fac1dfa84cf6ba08225cc81f62ea9c8be \
    --control-plane

Then you can join any number of worker nodes by running the following on each as root:

kubeadm join congo.ecocenter.live:6443 --token 4ie91s.ynlyq7gizp3u9b4b \
    --discovery-token-ca-cert-hash sha256:6d1780525a2467ce9c1ed9f1a25f8c9fac1dfa84cf6ba08225cc81f62ea9c8be
